## CC Base / MLS mode configuration START
#
# The environment variable of SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG governs the use
# of the Linux kernel random number generator by the OpenSSH daemon,
# the client as well as ssh-keygen.
#
# If this environment variable is set to 1 the mentioned applications
# use /dev/random for seeding the OpenSSL deterministic random number
# generator which is in turn used for generating key material. If this
# environment variable is set to 0, /dev/urandom is used.
#
# The seeding is performed at the following code paths:
#
# sshd:       startup of the daemon
# sshd:       forking of a new child to handle a new incoming connection
# ssh:        startup of the application
# ssh-keygen: startup of the application
#
# The evaluated configuration requires this variable to be set to a value
# greater than zero to ensure high-quality seed information to be used.
# To comply with these requirements set forth by the evaluation, you MUST
# set this variable to 1 or a larger value as indicated in the following.
# In addition to enabling this environment variable at this place,
# you MUST enable the same variable in /etc/profile or /etc/csh.login
# (as appropriate) to ensure that ssh and ssh-keygen are seeded with
# /dev/random and be compliant to the evaluated configuration requirements.
#
# SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG specifies the number of bytes read from /dev/random.
# The minimum is 6 bytes - so any value below 6 still implies that 6 bytes
# are read. The BSI requirements recommend to use 96 bits of entropy and
# requires 48 bits. Therefore, the absolute minimum is 6 bytes and the
# default configuration is 12 bytes.
#
# NOTE: when setting this variable to a value greater than zero, the
#       applications will block during seeding or re-seeding until sufficient
#       data pulled out of /dev/random. This may cause delays in startup or
#       connection initiation.
#
export SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG=12
#
# The following environment variable disables the use of the AES-NI
# Intel processor instruction set. This is required by BSI as the AES-NI
# instruction set was not subject to evaluation
